<h6> I regret to inform you that the development of my Discord bot - Dracks has come to a halt. Despite my best efforts, I encountered too serious stability issues on replit.it prevented me from proceeding further. As a result, future development on this project will not be pursued. This project has been a great learning experience and has taught me many new technical skills that we will carry forward in my future challenges. </h6>
